# Diabetic Retinopathy : Convolutional Neural Networks to cclassify the normal and affected retina from fundus images
### Data has been taken from 'http://www.it.lut.fi/project/imageret/diaretdb0/'
### Since the number of images to train is very less but still convolution net has been able to classify between affected and normal retina.
### In future versions will try to implement the same architecture over a bigger dataset say 'https://www.kaggle.com/c/diabetic-retinopathy-detection/data'
